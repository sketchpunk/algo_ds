/*
The idea is to break the numbers down into buckets at each digit.
So we have 10 buckets, representing 0 to 9, then we get the max digit size, thats how many iterations we need to do.
So for each iteration, we get the number and pust the whole value in that bucket.

First iteration is 0, so digit at 0 of 1234 is 4. That means 1234 gets put in the bucket named 4.
At the end, we combine all mini arrays into one array again.

First iteration is 1, so digit at 1 of 1234 is 3. That means 1234 gets put in the bucket named 3.

So you keep going till your done. The process of breaking things down and putting them in their number buckets
then recombinding them with first-in first-out ends up having the numbers sorted.
